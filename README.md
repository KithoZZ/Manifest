# 个人绩效管理系统 (Personal Performance Management System） (WIP)
## 介绍
## 本系统由我司实习生 PotatoZhou 与零基础编程背景的人力同事 KithoZhou 联合打造 ——KithoZhou 主导产品构思，PotatoZhou 负责技术落地搭建。系统脱胎于公司现有绩效考核工具，核心用于助力员工个人年度目标高效落地，支持年度绩效→季度绩效→月度绩效 的层级拆解，各维度目标均可由用户自主定义。评分规则将严格依据任务完成进度判定，若最终评级为 D，在公司可是要被安排专项培训的哦（玩笑话～）。
##  This system was jointly created by our intern, PotatoZhou, and our HR colleague KithoZhou, who has no prior programming background—KithoZhou led the product ideation, while PotatoZhou was responsible for technical implementation. The system evolved from the company’s existing performance assessment tools and is designed to help employees efficiently achieve their annual goals. It supports the hierarchical breakdown of annual performance into quarterly and monthly objectives, with all dimensions customizable by users. Scoring rules are strictly based on task completion progress. If the final rating is a D, employees may be assigned specialized training at the company—just kidding!
